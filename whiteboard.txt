one possible solution {Create a board array with all possible values

Q1 - Current Row, don't test
Q1 - Put column conflicts in list
Q1 - Put major and minor diagnol conflicts in a list

Delete all the conflicts from the entire board array
  >current Row
  >current column
  >major diagnol
  >minor diagnol

Place Q2 at the closest remaining space (boardArray[0])
]
Repeat the same process for Q2, Q3, etc. until all rows and queens have been placed.}

if one possible solution produces and emptied board then it is not an actual solution.

Repeat process above with Q1 at next column...until we get n columns
